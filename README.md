A majority of this repository is a duplicate of BMSDasboard.
The difference mainly comes from the different Procfile so the secondary Heroku application can purely act as a node.js server.
The BMSDashboard main Heroku project required scraping capabilities from an external repository that runs off a javascript backend, the server.js file accomplishes this.
